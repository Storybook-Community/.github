## Storybook Community Collective

We are a group of Storybook contributors and addon authors who grouped up to help maintain popular Storybook addons. We publish maintenance updates for popular addons that are no longer maintained, and we develop and publish our own addons! When an addon's author no longer responds to Pull Requests and cannot be reached, the Storybook Community Collective steps in to provide a maintenance-only fork of the addon.

### Our original addons

### I want to help

Please note this group is invite-only and new members are vetted based on past contributions to the Storybook ecosystem. If you're the maintainer of a popular Storybook addon, or a longstanding contributor to Storybook, please get in touch with [Steve Dodier-Lazaro (aka Frog)](https://github.com/sidnioulz).

All contributors must abide by the [Contributor Covenant code of conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) and refrain from engaging in any form of hateful conduct.
