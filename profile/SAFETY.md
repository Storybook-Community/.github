## How to report inappropriate behavior

If you are running into a problem with a community member that you cannot solve on your own; particularly if you are experiencing harassment, hateful behaviour or any other inappropriate conduct, please get in touch with the organization owners.

## Handling of reports

In case of ongoing conflict or inappropriate behaviour, we strongly encourage using written communication and keeping a record of all past communications. This helps with investigating misconduct.

Any members found to be in violation of the code of conduct or to be engaging in hateful or inappropriate behaviour will be removed if 
1. there is sufficient evidence brought to the organization owners;
2. or if they have been convicted by a court for harassment, assault or hateful conduct against anyone including external people;
3. or if a protection order or restraining order was secured against them by anyone including external people

## Appeal process

There is no appeal process for decisions made by organization owners on the basis of submitted evidence. Decisions made on the basis of legal convictions or protective orders may be appealed only after the conviction or order is overturned.

## Alternatives

If you have an issue with an organization owner or do not feel comfortable reaching out to organization owners about your problem, please seek legal support in the applicable jurisdiction.
